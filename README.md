# Welcome to SAP Cloud Application Programming model samples

Find here the samples for the openSAP course [Building Applications with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model](https://open.sap.com/courses/cp7).

## Notes on the Demo in Week 4 Unit 4
To add all pipeline specific file to your project, run the following command:

```sh
cds add pipeline
```

Details on how to start your Jenkins in your own environment can be found in the [Operations Guide](https://github.com/SAP/devops-docker-cx-server/blob/master/docs/operations/cx-server-operations-guide.md).

Please note that other than shown in the video Jenkins now is secured by default with an admin user and password.
After you have started Jenkins with the command `cx-server start`, you can get the initial password by running `./cx-server initial-credentials`.
